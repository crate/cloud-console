Here, you can create a new project. To do so, click the *Create Project* button
at the top right. It will prompt you for a project name and a region you want
the project to be based in.

Fill out the desired information and confirm by clicking *Create* at the bottom
right corner.

Once a project has been created and is listed on the Projects page, you can
click on that project there to select it. Below the divider line on the
left-hand menu, the tabs for *Overview*, *Users* and *Settings* will now refer
to the selected project. For more information on how to interact with the
project through these pages, see their description in the
:ref:`cloud-reference:overview` in our documentation.
